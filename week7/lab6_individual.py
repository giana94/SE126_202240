#---------PROGRAM PROMPT-----------------
#Write a Python program that reads the data from the file and stores all data into appropriate lists. The program should then prompt the user for the personâ€™s last name they are searching for and display all available information on that person if they are found.  ***You must use the binary search method***.  The program should allow the user to search for as many people as they want. The program should also print a statement telling the user how many iterations of the search loop the program went through before finding (or not finding) the requested person.

#---------VARIABLE DICTIONARY-----------------
#lName              index[0] Last Name
#fName              index[1] First Name
#dob                index[2] Date of Birth
#records            records count
#binary_loop        binary loop count
#min                lowest starting index
#max                hightest starting index
#guess              starting middle index of binary search
#search             user input for Last Name
#---------MAIN PROGRAM-----------------
