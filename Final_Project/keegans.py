#Final Project
#Python Pals

#Program Prompt: Our program takes a list of rap/hip-hop albums and lists them out starting from album name, artist name, year, and whether itâ€™s explicit or not. Then the program will ask you to pick an option from a list of search methods:
#1.    Search my Album
#2.    Search by Artist
#3.    Search by Year
#4.    Give Random Album
#5.    Exit
#Depending on which option the user chooses, the program will use either binary search or sequential search. Then Random Album will give the user a random album from the list. Exit will just simply exit the program. Also, before each new search the screen will clear.

#Variable Dictionary:
#records - number of records in file
#album - list of the album titles
#artistName - list of the artists names
#year - list of the years
#exp - list of whether or not an album is explicit

#Functions:
def menu():
    os.system('cls')
